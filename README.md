GDSC-INSAT Machine Learning Department 2022-2023 Repository (workshops + projects)


## Welcome!

Hello GDSC INSAT members! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

This is Mouafak Dakhlaoui, head of Machine Learning Department 2022-2023. I am excited to start on this project, Machine Learning Department repository. The main objective of this repo is to make the content of our workshops easily accessible, and to document the machine learning projects made by you, members of GDSC INSAT, throughout this year.

Concerning projects, if you have any machine learning project idea, whether you have started working on the project or you don't even know where to start, please feel free to share your thoughts with us by filling this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch9_HWdEydIjoDdK_YRRrRGNQINjfT5W__0Fw3tSXk5YzFdg/viewform?usp=sf_link
