# Introduction to AI / ML
Hello GDSC INSAT members to our first session "Introduction to AI / ML"! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

In this introduction, we try to explain why artificial intelligence is considered a subject most worthy of study and we try to provide some general definitions. We then present two definitions of Machine Learning, and compare between two problem solving approaches ("explicitly programming" and using machine learning). We also present two notebooks to show, in more detail, how we tackle a machine learning problem.
    
## More resources:
If you are eager to learn more, I tried to present some more resources that helped me in my journey while learning machine learning.

â€¢ **"Python spÃ©cial machine learning" by Machine Learnia** is a good way to start: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82KLS2C_gNQ&list=PLO_fdPEVlfKqMDNmCFzQISI2H_nJcEDJq

â€¢ **Machine Learning Specialization** offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford, dives into more details: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction
